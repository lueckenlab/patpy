## 1.0.0

### Sample representation refactoring:

-   "cell type" is renamed to "cell group" everywhere to be more general
-   Some representation methods are renamed accordingly:
-   -   `CellTypesComposition` -> `CellGroupComposition`
-   -   `CellTypePseudobulk` -> `GroupedPseudobulk`
-   `patient_representation` argument is renamed to `sample_representation`
-   "Patient representation" is now renamed to "Sample representation" eveywhere
-   The base class is now called `SampleRepresentation` instead of `PatientRepresentation`. This is important only for developers, users shouldn't use it anyway

### Deleted

-   Not used `SCellBow` class
-   Example notebook in the documentation
